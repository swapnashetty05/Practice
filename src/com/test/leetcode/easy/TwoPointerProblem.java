		 * One important thing in the question is that the array is sorted. This means that all the duplicate elements will be adjacent to each other. 
		 * For e.g., in the array [1,2,2,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,7], we see all the duplicate elements are adjacent to each other.

			We can use this property of the sorted array containing duplicates to solve this question using the following steps â€”

			Check if the current and the next element are equal.
			If they are, we will skip the next element and will continue the procedure as long as we encounter the duplicates.
			If the elements are not duplicate, we will place the next (different) element next to the current element.
